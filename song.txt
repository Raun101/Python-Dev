Good people do bad things too
Pretend they don't know, but they do
It takes one to know your mind
You and me we are one of a kind, it's true
I like to feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearing me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (hey)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm making it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm making it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline

Lost in the magic with you
A pretty disguise from the truth
Truth is ugly, don't open your eyes
I can change, I can change with just one more lie

I like to feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearin' me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (hey)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm making it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm making it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline

Borderline
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (borderline)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm making it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (die)
Borderline (borderline)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm making it right (make it, make it right)
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up in this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die
Borderline (borderline)

I know I said that I could change (stuck on you)
I don't know what to do about
A man that's this beautiful (felt like you)
I cross my heart and hope to die (hope to die)
