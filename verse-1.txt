Good people do bad things too
Pretend they don't know, but they do
It takes one to know your mind
You and me we are one of a kind, it's true
I like to feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearing me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (hey)
